WebStudio Project: Technical Overview This project is a modern, responsive
corporate landing page engineered for high performance across all screen sizes,
with a special focus on the seamless experience required by mobile devices (like
Redmi). It serves as the primary business presentation and lead generation tool
for the company.

Key Technical Achievements The site was built using semantic HTML5 and modular
CSS (SCSS), adopting a Mobile-First methodology and implementing three robust
breakpoints for full adaptability.

Crucially, performance optimization was achieved by deploying the <picture>
element and srcset across all main images. This ensures that only the correctly
sized and optimized image is loaded for the user's device, significantly
reducing mobile load times and providing crisp visuals on 2x Retina and high-DPI
screens.

For enhanced User Experience (UX), the project integrated key interactive
features: a functional mobile hamburger menu for intuitive navigation on
touchscreens, and a JavaScript-driven modal window connected to a contact form
for immediate lead capture. The entire site maintains accessibility standards
through ARIA usage and a consistent application of modern coding principles.

Business Value The WebStudio platform successfully addresses the core business
need for a credible online presence. It is designed to quickly establish trust
by showcasing the team and portfolio, and to actively drive conversions through
clear Calls-to-Action and an accessible lead generation form.
